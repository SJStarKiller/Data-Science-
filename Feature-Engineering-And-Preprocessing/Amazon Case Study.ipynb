       "\"I purchased this watch because I was tired of waiting for another smart watch whose name will not be mentioned. Anyway: This watch is fine so far (I just received it tonight).Setup was a bit of a pain. *Before you set up the watch be sure to download these two applications: 'Smart Connect' and 'Smartwatch 2'.*If you're using NFC pairing then lay your watch flat on its face then slide the back of your phone against the back of the watch until you either hear or feel the watch vibrate. Keep the phone close to the watch and it will load up.Once the setup is complete you're free to go to the Smart Connect application and download applications that come with the phone. Whilst downloading one application, scroll down to see other recommended applications. I'm glad that this watch has been released for some time now because when it first came out, the applications I downloaded (like Spotify) weren't available.Pros:Lightweight.Is comfortable on my wrist.Easy to swipe from screen to screen.Brightness - My brightness is dimmed down quite a lot (less than 25%) and the screen is still clearly visible.Infinite possibilities with application creation.Price - Way cheaper than Samsung Galaxy Gear (almost half the cost).ConsSetup process - See above.Messages - The messages read individually as if on an old flip phone; the messages are not grouped together. Not that big of an issue, but still worth mentioning.Watch faces - Not many watch faces are offered, but I found one that I like nevertheless.'Limited colors' - I put this in quotes and under cons because while you can change out the wristband, I've read reviews stating that if you do it voids the warranty.If you were deciding between this item (Smartwatch 2) or the Samsung Galaxy Gear then choose this.Will continually update as the time moves on.------------------------------------------------Update 23/2/14: Charge appears to hold for three days. Uses include checking the weather, messages, receiving calls and the occasional Facebook message. However, there is a slight problem; whilst charging/after the watch is done charging, the battery bar that is displayed is never full. Even when I first received the watch and fully charged it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 24/2/14: Problem about the charge has been remedied. If you're using a Samsung/Galaxy device, then you can simply use your phone charger to charge your watch. This has worked for me and now has my watch at 100% battery. I won't charge it again until the battery runs out to truly confirm the battery life.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 26/2/14: Charge is holding quite fine after two days of use. Battery is ever so slightly starting to go down, which means it might make it past three days and all it truly needed was a full charge via the phone charger. I've run into a 'problem' whilst trying to delete applications from the watch. I'll list the steps as best as possible-On your phone click on the application you wish to delete > Hit the home button > Hold the home button > Hold the application until the tiny menu pops up > Click 'App info' > Click 'Uninstall' > Click 'OK'.Go to your Smartwatch > Find the application you just deleted from your phone > Click on it > -Once that is done, the application should remove itself. It's easier than it appears to be; it's just a lot of steps which are quite easy, and are really small steps.The only problem is deleting pre-installed applications. This cannot be done, so be wary of what you install on your Smartwatch from the pre-installed application list when'st you first get it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/1/14Day SIX of NO CHARGE! This watch is amazing! Only problem currently is the lack of the weather application to be able to open. This could possibly (and hopefully) be due to not having a full charge or near a full charge. The battery looks to be at about 25% currently, and I do have a double today at work. The watch might just make it for seven full days with only one full charge (or even longer?). This is incredible. I'm not too sure if the watch will still work as just as a watch (being able to ONLY tell the time) when the battery dies. I suppose I'll find out.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3/2/14Holy crap! DAY SEVEN!!! This morning, around 11 a.m. before I left for work, the watch vibrated and said '10%'. And guess what? It's still on and hasn't died yet and I have been using it excessively since last night and today. It's holding up just fine. I really want to reiterate: *IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BETWEEN THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2 or the GALAXY GEAR THEN GET THE SONY SMARTWATCH 2!* -It's still holding it's full charge for seven days (one week) now, even with moderate AND excessive use. This watch is truly better than the Galaxy Gear, and half the cost too! It does exactly what you'd want it to do. Notifies you of a notification, be it Facebook, text, Snapchat, Kik, etc. If you get the Galaxy Gear you have the option to reply back on the watch. Hello...the screen is so much smaller AND it's in T9 (which is where you have to type the number 1 three times if you want to get to the letter 'C'). Also, with all the reviews I read on that, I highly doubt the Galaxy Gear's charge can hold up to this.*This watch's rating is going from a 4 Star to a 5 Star. This has been truly impressive and has held up now since I got it back on the 18th of February. This will be my last edit to this review as there's not much else to say that I haven't already.---I know my review is long, but if you read the whole thing, you'll be glad you did. The review helps with daily entries of how the watch holds up!,I thought the first Sony watch was a bit gimmicky with the clip.I wanted a watch that looked like a watch and acted like one with God battery life and could stand up to weather/water.I held out for the galaxy gear but alas it was heavy, short battery life (a day is nuts) had an awkward charger and feels like a bracelet.Granted the galaxy gear is more powerful in that it is actually a standalone android device but it doesn't work for me because the battery life and weight/bulk isn't worth it.The number one thingi like about the Sony sw2 is the screen is visible in direct sunlight. It usesa transflective display like those found on many outdoor GPS units. The watch has a back light too. There is only one button. Press once to turn on the backlight and twice to go to the app screen. The light sensor checks to see if actually you are in bright light and controls the backlight so it is only really on when you need it.  It is true the screen isn't as brilliant in color as the oled on the galaxy gear.. But then if you are in the bright sunlight you cant read your galaxy gear screen.  The Sony sw2 screen when it is 'dark' (no backlight) can be read with normal indoor lighting.  There is no need special code like in the galaxy gear to turn on the screen when you rotate your wrist. The screen watch mode is always present and readable in even low indoor lighting... Lay your watch on a table and you can still read it!And it's that screen that saves battery! I was expecting the bald galaxy gear to do this but no. That takes me to my second like for the Sony sw2... Battery life.  Here I do wish it was longer. I wanted it to be like the pebble but am happy it is multi day.  After my first few days of constant play I didn't expect great life but was happy to see I was getting two full days.  Now that I've settled into a routine of sorts I'm starting to see 3 to 4 days. I would like more but it's nice not to remember to charge it every day.  It uses a micro USB to charge so I can always borrow or charge it else where. No need to carry around a special charger bracelet like the galaxy gear requires.  I also note that it charges fairly fast. Haven't timed it yet but it's so short that I only carry one charger on trips to charge my phone and watch.Style. I like the style. It looks likea watch first and is smart second. Most ppl I show it to don't ask me if it is a smart watch. They see it as a watch and are actually surprised it is a smart watch. Its a nice style. However it is a MENS sized watch. Women may find it a bit large.Water resistant not waterproof. I wish it was waterproof. But I've worn iton my bicycle in the rain and taken it to the shower a few times. I'm hesitant to force getting it emmersed and try to take it off for the shower or swimming. The protection is a small rubber bit inside the charging cover. Mechanically I see the only weakness to the watch is that the charging cover may snap off over time or the seal will wear out and water/dust will eventually get in through the charging port.Apps. While not like the galaxy gear the Sony watch does not run android native. It utilizes the android adk concept (accessory development kit) so the Sony watch is more like a remote display and touch screen to your phone.  This means that it works best when it is actually connected to your phone. The phone is the brains for most of the apps. That helps with battery life but it also means your watch is not very smart when it is not connected to the phone (galaxy gear better if you want a stand alone smart accessory.. Or at least it could be)Apps... I've only download the free apps and I wrote one of my own (take the heartrate from a Bluetooth hr strap and display it on the watch).. I've been able to take notes on the phone and keepa copy on the watch (after you save the note it is on your phone and watch even if the watch is later disconnected from your phone).. Sync email (can't edit/send with the app I've chosen) get SMS (can send pure written replies but can't actually edit to send SMS but assume just app limitation)I've used the Bluetooth range anda phone finder app a lot. The watch vibrates when it loses connection with the phone and vibrates again when in range. If I can't find the phone once it is connected a find phone free app can be used on the watch to make the phone play a tune.Execution. The watch is fairly stable though I've experienced a few quirks that has required to pair again. I think it had to do withmy phone Bluetooth settings and some of the free sw1 apps not being stable.  Overall it is stable enough for me to keep.,What I Liked:-Lightweight-Stylish and doesn't scream 'IM A SMARTWATCH'-Always on low-powered display that tells you the time and date-Changeable watch face designs, provided by Sony-Long lasting battery-IP57 Weather & Dust ResistantWhat I didn't like:-Cheap factory watch strap that attracts lint and dust-Low Resolution Screen-Clunky Apps and App installation methods-Loud Vibrating alert mechanism that has no sensitivity control-No Speaker-No MicrophoneMy Thoughts:Like anything 'new-tech', at the time for those who will be buying smart watches in the next few months, are early adopters.There will be bugs, there will be defects and there will be something better around the corner in the following months that will do it better, faster and last longer.That being said, the Sony Smart Watch 2 is a neat device that gives you an extension of notifications from your Smart Phone to your wrist.It is packaged with an awful, cheap, and dust/dirt attracting watch band that fellow reviewers complain about breaking easily after use. I agree, it does seem very fragile. Quit being cheap Sony and bundle this baby with a decent watch strap!Why did I choose this watch over its competitors?Unlike the Galaxy Gear by Samsung, the Sony Smart Watch 2 battery lasts longer, about 4 days per charge of average use versus 48 hours as many report with the Galaxy Gear. The Sony is weather/water/dust resistant according to IP57 standards. So I could get away with wearing this watch in the shower, outdoors in crazy weather, and the occasional splash of water whilst the washing of my hands.Additionally, the Sony Smart Watch 2 has a 'Low-Power' reflective display that enables the device to always show the current time and day-date on the watch face at a glance whether on your wrist or the table. The Galaxy Gear has to powered on by a defined motion or the pressing of the watches button.I honestly like being able to glance down quickly at my wrist and see the time versus doing anything else to produce the display to show me what day and time it is. This feature of the Sony is simply genius and executed beautifully and legible even in the lowest of ambient light. When it gets pitch black dark, simply press the button on the Sony's side and the display is illuminated.Water & weather resistance, a longer battery life, and the ability read the watch face at a glance without needing any additional input is why I chose the SW2 over Galaxy Gear. Albeit Sony's watch has a lower-res display and you cannot place or take calls via the watch itself. I found myself entering predefined text message replies so I could at least respond to incoming texts. There is no on-screen keyboard provided by Sony's apps. There are some that you can purchase by developers in the Google Play market.Pebble smart watch just looks like an etch-a-sketch with an ugly and bulky fascia. Perhaps the Pebble Steel will fancy it up a notch, well the fascia anyway. I like a screen, a coloured screen. I am biased as I purely discredited the Pebble for it's e-paper ink display type. The cool feature I like of the new Pebble Steel is a built in status LED that can notify you of missed calls, emails, and messages.I use this watch with my Samsung Note 3. It is awkward because you have to download apps within the app for apps on the watch. You download an app that is made by Sony that syncs the Apps to your watch via bluetooth and also handles any firmware updates to the watch itself. The Gmail app keeps crashing on my Galaxy Note 3 and tends to bug out on the phone as well.Sony just pushed it's Smart Watch 3 blueprints through to the FCC. Expect a new Sony Smart Watch 3 in the coming weeks or months. Additionally the new Galaxy Gear 2 will be out. Here we go again!Personally, I am going to wait and see what else is brought to the table, that is unless I can score the Sony, Pebble, or Galaxy older models at a price under $100.Any questions or comments, post away I'll be more than happy to help.,This review attempts to discuss attributes of the Smartwatch 2 not shown on Youtube or Geek sites for prospective buyers considerations and research purposes.I guess the best feature of the Smartwatch 2 is its ability to Auto pair the device with your handset via the NFC tap. You must be running Android 4.2 or greater on your phone!You must download the Sony app called Smart Connect to download apps that are specific to the watch. The caveat here is that you need to have purchased and paired the two in order to see 'what it can do'. There is no clear way to evaluate the capabilities prior to purchase.This can also be said for the Samsung Gear device as well. I look at this the same as I would the 15 minute app evaluation offered by the Play Store except on a higher dollar level. Neither offer the consumer a comfortable evaluation level.One can only hope there will be better OEM firmware updates and better 'useful' third party apps on the horizon. Case in point and obviously one of the major detraction's to the Smartwatch 2 is the limited selection of clock faces!Granted there is a third party app called Custom Watch that adds 14 new watch face templates that are customizable but this app suffers in that it closes when the watch display goes into sleep, as it will revert back to the Sony clock face in embedded in firmware.I should point out that there is an option to do what the developer calls Use as Watch, which keeps the Custom Face focused at the risk of a faster battery depletion.Another minor annoyance is the leading Zero digit always displayed. Example: 8:12PM will read 08:12 even though the PM is displayed. You can also select 24 hour clock as a work around to this if you prefer a military time style display.Also I should mention that the charging port cover does not offer much purchase for the fingernail to open, it is a plastic not rubber type door. With that said the watch body and wake button are very well made. The black silicone strap so far seems impervious to collecting lint that some straps are prone to do.The alert vibrate is perfect on this watch quiet but noticable with a non adjustable 10 second display timeout. The OS is reasonably fast and fluid on it. The Sony branded GMail and SMS extensions (as they are called) will prove useful to most buyers and there are several extensions from Sony that others will find important like the included fitness app, twitter, remote camera, find phone, calendar, facebook, etc.There are many free game and game like apps on the Play Store that are interesting but not very productive for just killing 'Time' ;)Compared to Smartwatch 1 with the LiveWare bluetooth connectivity this watch is superior in its ability to discretely stay in the loop with email and sms. But not so much to customize it as amoled watch. But compared to Samsung's Gear with the whopping 1.9Mpix wart on the band this watch has more appeal to it and hopefully the Gear 2 will be absent of the camera feature for a sleeker wear.All in all it's a nice product and after fiddling with it for a few days i'll be keeping it, but as an honest review with this firmware revision it's just not ready for prime Time unless one insists on up to the second notifications of incoming communications.EDIT UPDATE:- As of yesterday 1/7/2014; there was an update to the Custom Watch app which lets you set AND KEEP ALIVE any of the Custom Watch faces even after the 10 second time out before the watch falls into sleep mode or what Sony calls Low Power. What this means to the wearer is that you do not have to re-select a custom face any time you pick up the watch or back out of a SMS/email read.It also looks like he did some power refinements as well. After installing the update yesterday and then a full charge now it's 24 hours later the battery reads 90% full charge. So now I upgrade it from meh to ehh.\""
