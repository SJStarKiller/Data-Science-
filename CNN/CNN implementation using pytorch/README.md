This notebook is for basic intro of how you can implement image processing task through CNN using Pytorch as Neural Network API. 

This is just like a Hello World program which we all implement when we first start coding same goes with deep learning or computer vision 
to be precise we use the dataset which is common on which we can train our model easily.

This notebook does not include any hyperperameter tuning process and it is good for basic intro and to get indepth overview and 
how you can work with neural network with pytorch I would recommend you to have a look on [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG)
Playlist on youtube. This playlist will give you indepth knowledge about steps which are not covered in this notebook.
